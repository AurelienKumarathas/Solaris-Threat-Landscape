# Cyber Security Threat Landscape
## Solaris Threat Landscape Report

### 
*To provide insights into the current cybersecurity threats affecting Solaris. In order to guide strategic decisions regarding security investments, controls, and risk management.*

## 1. Executive Summary

Solaris operates three critical healthcare applications: MedTrack Pro, HealthHub Mobile, and CareConnect360. These systems handle sensitive patient data, including personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive health information (SPI). The threat landscape for Solaris is shaped by the healthcare industry’s compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA), the sensitive nature of data processed, and the reliance on cloud infrastructure (AWS). This report outlines current and emerging threats, key vulnerabilities, and recommendations for mitigating risks.

## 2. Applications Overview

| Name Of Applications        |           |
| -------- | -------------- |
| MedTrack Pro | Medication tracking and reminder application, integrated with HealthHub Mobile. |
| HealthHub Mobile | A mobile health management app that allows patients to manage their health records, schedule appointments, and engage in telehealth.|
| CareConnect360| A patient management system that enables healthcare providers to communicate, collaborate, and deliver holistic care. |



## 3. Key Threat Categories

### 3.1 External Threats



|      | Ransomware Attacks    | Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks | Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) |
|----------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Overview | The healthcare sector is one of the primary targets for ransomware. Malicious actors may target Solaris’s applications to disrupt healthcare services or demand payment in exchange for restoring access to data.        | These attacks could target Solaris employees or even patients, aiming to steal credentials or distribute malware.                           | APT groups often target high-value systems in healthcare to access PII and sensitive health data. They may infiltrate Solaris systems through unpatched vulnerabilities and remain undetected while stealing data.|
| Mitigation | Implement frequent backups, use anti-malware tools, and create a robust incident response plan.      | Regular training for employees and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user access.                          | Monitor network traffic with anomaly detection tools and conduct regular penetration testing.                   |



### 3.2 Internal Threats


|      | Insider Threats    | Data Mismanagement| 
|----------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Overview| Employees or contractors could intentionally or unintentionally expose patient data. An insider could misuse privileged access or make configuration errors that expose data.      | Misconfigurations in cloud services (AWS), such as misconfigured S3 buckets or improper database access permissions, could lead to data leaks.   |                     |
| Mitigation| Enforce least-privilege access policies, monitor user activities, and implement role-based access control (RBAC).    | Regular audits and automated security checks for cloud configurations. | 
|

### 3.3 Vulnerabilities

| | Zero-Day Vulnerabilities | API Security Risks |
|---| ----- | ------|
|Overview| Unpatched or unknown vulnerabilities in application frameworks (e.g., React.js, Node.js) could be exploited by attackers before a patch is released.|As Solaris applications rely heavily on RESTful APIs to integrate with other systems (e.g., MedTrack Pro with HealthHub Mobile, CareConnect360 with MedTrack Pro), API vulnerabilities could expose sensitive data.|
| |Implement a vulnerability management program and subscribe to security advisories. | Use strong authentication mechanisms for APIs, encrypt API traffic, and conduct API security testing.
|

### 3.4 Cloud Infrastructure Threats



|   |Cloud Misconfigurations| Denial-of_Service (DoS) Attacks| Shared Responsibility Model Risks|
|-----|---|---|---| 
|Overview| AWS misconfigurations, such as public exposure of EC2 instances or S3 buckets, could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. |Attackers could target Solaris’s cloud infrastructure, causing outages and disrupting critical healthcare services.| While AWS provides infrastructure security, Solaris is responsible for securing applications, data, and workloads. Misunderstandings of this model could lead to security gaps.
|Mitigation| Use AWS’s native security services (e.g., AWS Config, Amazon Inspector) and conduct routine audits.|Implement AWS Shield and CloudFront to protect against DoS attacks.| Ensure thorough understanding of AWS's Shared Responsibility Model and implement robust cloud security controls.
|



## 4. Regulatory and Compliance Threats

| | HIPAA Non-Compliance| General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Risks (if applicable) |
|---|---|---|
Overview|  Ensure thorough understanding of AWS's Shared Responsibility Model and implement robust cloud security controls. | For any patient data from EU citizens, Solaris must comply with GDPR, which imposes strict data privacy and consent requirements.|
| Mitigation| Ensure data encryption, proper access controls, regular HIPAA audits, and employee training programs. | Ensure that consent mechanisms, data access, and data erasure protocols are in place.
|


## 5. Emerging Threats


| | Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Driven Attacks | Quantum Computing Threats|
|---|---|----|
Overview| AI is being used by attackers to create more sophisticated attacks, such as highly targeted phishing campaigns or automated vulnerability exploitation. | With advances in quantum computing, traditional encryption methods may become obsolete, posing a long-term threat to data encryption.
| Mitigation| Invest in AI-driven defense tools and threat intelligence to detect AI-driven threats.| Explore post-quantum cryptographic solutions and stay updated on encryption advancements.
|

## 6. Threat Actors

| | Cybercriminals | Hacktivists| State-Sponsored Actors
|---|---|----| ---| 
Overview| Target Solaris’s applications for financial gain through ransomware or data theft.| May target healthcare applications to disrupt services as part of broader social or political campaigns. | Motivated by economic or political goals, may target sensitive healthcare data for intelligence gathering or to disrupt critical infrastructure.





## 7. Recommendations

|| Proactive Monitoring| Enhanced Endpoint Security| Regular Security Assessments|Cloud Security Best Practices| Data Encryption and Backup|
|---|---|----|---| ----| ----| 
Overview | Leverage tools like Prometheus and the ELK Stack for real-time monitoring and centralized logging. Implement an automated alerting system for suspicious activity. | Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to prevent malware or ransomware attacks targeting Solaris’s endpoints. | Conduct regular penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. | Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce least-privilege access, AWS Shield for DoS protection, and AWS Config for cloud configuration monitoring. | Ensure all data at rest and in transit is encrypted (TLS/SSL) and implement regular data backups with versioning to recover from ransomware attacks.




## 8. Summary


The healthcare sector is one of the most targeted industries due to the high value of patient data. Solaris, with its critical healthcare applications, must continue to adopt a proactive security posture. Addressing both internal and external threats, implementing best practices in cloud security, and maintaining regulatory compliance are essential to ensuring the security and resilience of Solaris’s applications.
